# Word Probe (experimental)

This `word probe` example uses composition to demonstrate how to implement states in a package and import them in a dataflow. The word example has two services. The first service reads `sentences`, divides them into words, and stores their count into a state. The second service listens for `words` from the data stream, looks them up in the state, and returns their count.

The following diagram is a visual representation of these operations generated by `sdf`:

Checkout [dataflows-inline/word-probe] for the inline variant.
