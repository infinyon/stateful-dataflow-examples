# Split Sentence

The split sentence `dataflow` splits sentences into words and counts the number of characters. The following diagram is a visual representation of these operations generated by `sdf`:

#### Package Variant

If you prefer to run this dataflow using packages, run the [package-variant](./package-variant/README.md) instead.


## Step-by-step

Take a look at the [dataflow.yaml](./dataflow.yaml) to see how we've implemented it.


### Run the Dataflow

Use `sdf` command line tool to run the dataflow:

```bash
sdf run --ui
```

Use `--ui` to generate the graphical representation and run the Studio.


### Test the Dataflow

The sample data file used to run this test `./sample-data/data.txt` has the following records:

```bash
Hello world
Hi there
```

Produce the data to the `sentences` topic:

```bash
fluvio produce sentences -f ./sample-data/data.txt
```

Checkout the data in `sentences` topic:

```bash
fluvio consume sentences -Bd
```

Consume from `words` to retrieve the result:

```bash
fluvio consume words -Bd
```

```bash
Hello(5)
world(5)
Hi(2)
there(5)
```

### Show State

Check the counters `sdf` terminal:

```bash
show state sentence-words/sentence-to-words/metrics
```

```bash
show state sentence-words/augment-count/metrics
```

Congratulations! You've successfully built and run a dataflow!


### Clean-up

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash
sdf clean --force
```
