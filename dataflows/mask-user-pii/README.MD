# Mask User Private Indentity Information (PII)

The mask user PII `dataflow` reads JSON records and uses Regex to mask Social Security Numbers (SSNs). The following diagram is a visual representation of these operations generated by `sdf`:

#### Package Variant

If you prefer to run this dataflow using packages, run the [package-variant](./package-variant/README.md) instead.


## Step-by-step

Take a look at the [dataflow.yaml](./dataflow.yaml) to see how we've implemented it.


### Run the Dataflow

Use `sdf` command line tool to run the dataflow:

```bash
sdf run --ui
```

Use `--ui` to generate the graphical representation and run the Studio.


### Test the Dataflow

The sample data file used to run this test `./sample-data/data.txt` has the following records:

```json
{"name": "Alice", "ssn": "555-12-1212"}
{"name": "Bob", "ssn": "123-45-6789"}
```

Produce the data to in `user-info` topic:

```bash
fluvio produce user-info -f ./sample-data/data.txt
```

Checkout the data in `user-info` topic:

```bash
fluvio consume user-info -Bd
```

Consume from `masked` to retrieve the result:

```bash
fluvio consume masked -Bd
```

```json
{"name": "Alice", "ssn": "***-**-****"}
{"name": "Bob", "ssn": "***-**-****"}
```


## Clean-up

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash
sdf clean --force
```
