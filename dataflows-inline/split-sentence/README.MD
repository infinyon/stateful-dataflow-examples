# Split Sentence

The split sentence `dataflow` splits sentences into words and counts the number of characters. The following diagram is a visual representation of these operations generated by `sdf`:

## Step-by-step

Take a look at the [dataflow.yaml](./dataflow.yaml) to get an idea of what we're doing.
Make sure to [Install SDF & Start a Cluster].


### Run the Dataflow

Use `sdf` command line tool to run the dataflow:

```bash
sdf run --ui
```

Use `--ui` to generate the graphical representation and run the Studio.


### Test the Dataflow

1. Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash
fluvio produce sentence
```

```bash
Hello world
Hi there
```

Consume from `words` to retrieve the result:

```bash
fluvio consume words -Bd
```

```bash
Hello(5)
world(5)
Hi(2)
there(5)
```

## Show State

Check the counters `sdf` terminal:

```bash
>> show state sentence-words/sentence-to-words/metrics --table
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       2          0
```

```bash
>> show state sentence-words/augment-count/metrics --table
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       4          0
```

Congratulations! You've successfully built and run a dataflow!


## Clean-up

Exit `sdf` terminal and remove the topics:

```bash
fluvio topic delete sentence
fluvio topic delete words
```
